# running

Some Jupyter notebooks that play with various personal running and racing statistics. So far:

* [Geographic data](https://github.com/willettk/running/blob/master/notebooks/baa.ipynb) for runners in the 2017 Boston Marathon. Find all countries that had exactly one runner in the race - ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡±, for example. 
* [Slicing race results](https://github.com/willettk/running/blob/master/notebooks/race_analysis.ipynb) from willettk.github.io. Filter on distance, find personal bests, look at progression of PRs lifetime, display races run more than once, distinct polities, etc.
